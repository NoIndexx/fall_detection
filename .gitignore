# Optional: If you have very large raw data in sub1/, sub2/ etc. and don't want to track them.
# Consider adding them like this:
# sub*/*/Falls/*.xlsx
# sub*/*/ADLs/*.xlsx
# sub*/*/Near_Falls/*.xlsx
# Or more generally:
# sub*/*/*.xlsx
# Be careful with this, as it will ignore all .xlsx files in those subdirectories.
# If you want to track some, this approach is too broad.

# If your plots/ directory contains generated images you don't want to track:
# plots/*.png
# plots/*.jpg
# plots/*.pdf
